 * A value that's interpolated directly into the template before parsing.

 * Static values cannot be updated, since they don't define a part and are
 * effectively merged into the literal part of a lit-html template. Because
 * they are interpolated before the template is parsed as HTML, static values
 * may occupy positions in the template that regular interpolations may not,
 * such as tag and attribute names.
 *
 * UnsafeStatic values are inherently very unsafe, as the name states. They
 * can break well-formedness assumptions and aren't escaped, and thus a
 * potential XSS vulnerability if created from user-provided data.
 *
 * It's recommended that no user templates ever use UnsafeStatic directly,
 * but directive-like functions are written by library authors to validate
 * and sanitize values for a specific purpose, before wrapping in an
 * UnsafeStatic value.
 *
 * An example would be a `tag()` directive that lets a template contain tags
 * whose names aren't known until runtime, like:
 *
 *     html`<${tag(myTagName)}>Whoa</${tag(MyElement)}>`
 *
 * Here, `tag()` should validate that `myTagName` is a valid HTML tag name,
 * and throw if it contains any illegal characters.
