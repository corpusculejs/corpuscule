A lightweight set of decorators for creating DOM-dependent context for web components.

Context is an approach to share some data for all components in a some DOM tree branch. It creates
a local state that is accessible from any component on any nesting level without direct forwarding
properties through the whole chain of children.

It was invented and popularized by [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

This package also uses approach to implement context for web components suggested by Justin Fagnani
in [his talk](https://youtu.be/6o5zaKHedTE).
